## Features:
* Dynamic generation of pages using [Dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate) (a python library). Might not be very efficient on a large scale, however allows for flexibility
* Multi-Language** support. The language of the page is determined using either browser's prefered language or user's previous selection (stored in cookies)
* Responsive design using CSS and JQuery
* Dynamic fetching of customer reviews using **Google's Business API**.
